Greetings from Himkamal Gohain
# python-face-recognition
1) clone the repository (Install git first) then paste this

       git clone https://github.com/darkphantom-gamer/python-face-recognition
   
in the windows powershell 

2)First you have to install python 3.10 or 3.12 You can easily get from VScode marketplace

3)Install opencv-python and face_recognition

just use this:-

      pip install -r requirements.txt

If u encounter error then u need to install dilb.. HOW? 

 I did all the work so u dont have to :)

navigate to Dilb_windows folder and in the top bar type powershell so a new window will appear

now just type 

    pip install < the package according to your version >

#Example
     pip install dlib-19.24.99-cp312-cp312-win_amd64  
after then just type

    pip install -r requirements.txt     

AFter which you need to edit the main.py according to your need ..

suppose image location
and at last

    python main.py
